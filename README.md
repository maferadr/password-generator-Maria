# Password Generator - Maria Angulo.

The following code deploys a dinamically Web Application in which the user will have the option to choose which criteria does he want to add in order to generate his own and secure Password. So that, the criteria are being considered by the following:

  1. The password must contain a minimum length of 8 characters and NO more than 128.

SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Acceptance Criteria.
GIVEN the user needs a new, secure password.
WHEN he clicks the button to generate a password,
THEN he's presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
WHEN prompted for password criteria through a function with conditionals,
THEN he selects which criteria to include in the password. 
WHEN prompted for the length of the password,
THEN he chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters, as specified in the prompt.
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password,
THEN he would be able to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
WHEN he answers each prompt,
THEN the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
WHEN all prompts are answered,
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
